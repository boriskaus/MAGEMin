External libraries		  
==================

**1. C and fortran compilers**

Using either ``gcc`` or clang to compile MAGEMin is up to you as the runtime performances are similar. However, in the event you want to modify MAGEMin for your own use, I would advice that you compile MAGEMin with ``clang`` as the error handling system is more strict which will save you from having unexpected segfaults errors...

.. code-block:: shell

	sudo apt-get install gcc
	sudo apt-get install clang
	sudo apt-get install gfortran

**2. Open MPI** (Message Passing Interface)

.. code-block:: shell

	sudo apt-get install openmpi-bin libopenmpi-dev

Note that ``mpich`` can equally be used.

**3. lapacke** (C version of the fotran lapack library)

.. code-block:: shell

	sudo apt-get install liblapacke-dev

**4. NLopt** (Non Linear optimization library)

First ``cmake`` must be installed on your machine

.. code-block:: shell
	
	sudo apt-get install cmake

Then ``NLopt`` can installed such as

.. code-block:: shell

	sudo apt-get install libnlopt-dev

Alternatively ``NLopt`` be downloaded and installed

.. code-block:: shell

	git clone https://github.com/stevengj/nlopt.git
	cd nlopt
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	make
	sudo make install

Done - all installed

MAGEMin
=======
	
Choose the ``C`` compiler in the first line of the ``Makefile`` by commenting out one

.. code-block:: shell

	#CC=gcc
	CC=clang

Make sure the open ``MPI`` paths for libraries and include directory in ``Makefile`` are correct. By default the paths to openmpi are the following:

.. code-block:: shell

	LIBS   += (...) -L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openmpi/lib -lmpi
	INC     = (...) -I/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openmpi/include/

Depending on the machine on which you want to install MAGEMin, you might need to manually give the paths to ``NLopt`` libraries and include directory too

.. code-block:: shell

	LIBS   += (...) --L/local/home/kwak/nlopt_install/install/lib -lnlopt 
	INC     = (...) -I/local/home/kwak/nlopt_install/install/include

If you are using ``Lockless`` memory allocator, add the following flag in the ``Makefile``:

.. code-block:: shell

	LIBS   += (...) -lllalloc

Then compile MAGEMin:

.. code-block:: shell
	
	make clean; make all;

Note that by default the optimization flag ``-O3`` and debugging flag ``-g`` are used.

To test if MAGEMin compilation was successful you can for instance check the version of MAGEMin by running:

.. code-block:: shell
	
	./MAGEMin --version
